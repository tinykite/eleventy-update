I have 5+ years of experience with UI/UX development. I’m also an experienced writer and editor—with several experience working at magazines that include American Craft, Monkeybicycle, Paper Darts, and Yoga International. And in my free time, I create storytelling-driven websites and minimalist illustrations.
