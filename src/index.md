I went to a [small art school](https://www.colum.edu/) for fiction writing and spent the first several years of my career at magazines that include _American Craft_, _Monkeybicycle,_ _Paper Darts_, and _Yoga International_. So I can't help but feel excited about exploring how the web can be used to tell meaningful narratives.

I currently work as a front-end engineer with a focus on design systems, complex user interactions, and web animation.

In my free time, I often [illustrate plants](https://www.instagram.com/tinykitelab/).
