I spent the first several years of my career working for magazines that include _American Craft_, _Monkeybicycle,_ _Paper Darts_, and _Yoga International_. And I can't help but feel incorrigibly excited about storytelling on the web—

But I'm also just as passionate about design systems, accessibility, and performant web animation.
