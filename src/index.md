For the last several years I've built intuitive web applications and advocated for the value of centering inclusive design. In my free time, I also love to draw minimalist illustrations of the outdoors and create interactive, participatory websites.

Before becoming a developer, I went to school for creative writing — and honed my skills as a journalist and essayist for magazines that include _Yoga International_, _Paper Darts_, _American Craft_, and _Monkeybicycle_ plus the anthology _The Way We Sleep_.
