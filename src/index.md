I love building interactive tools, design systems, and data visualizations — and advocating for those products to center accessibility and inclusive design principles.

Before becoming a developer, I went to school for creative writing — and honed my skills as a journalist and essayist for magazines that include _Yoga International_, _Paper Darts_, _American Craft_, and _Monkeybicycle_ plus the anthology _The Way We Sleep_.

In my free time, I love to create minimalist illustrations of the outdoors and create interactive, participatory websites.
