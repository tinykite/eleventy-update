After attending a small [art school](https://www.colum.edu/) for fiction writing, I spent the first several years of my career at magazines that include _American Craft_, _Monkeybicycle,_ _Paper Darts_, and _Yoga International_. I love learning about new ways to tell meaningful narratives on the web: especially hybrid approaches that mix data, design, and interaction into participatory experiences that are accessible to everyone.

I currently work as a front-end engineer, with a UI/UX focus that includes in-depth experience with design systems, accessibility, and web animation.

And when I'm not coding? I love to spend time creating [minimalist illustrations of plants](https://www.instagram.com/tinykitelab/).
