For the last several years I've built intuitive web applications and advocated for inclusive design. In my free time, I also love to draw minimalist illustrations of the outdoors and build interactive, participatory websites.

Before focusing on all that, I went to school for creative writing — and honed my skills as a journalist and essayist for magazines that include _Yoga International_, _Paper Darts_, _American Craft_, and _Monkeybicycle_ plus the anthology _The Way We Sleep_.

I don't write as frequently, or attempt to make quite as many bad jokes anymore. But I still love imagining ways in which storytelling can meaningfully shape the web.
