## 1. Randomized Air Bubbles

During my front-end design apprenticeship at Sparkbox in 2018, I had a lot of fun creating a series of several different animated wildlife scenes for the [A Modern Eden](https://amoderneden.netlify.app/) website. Most of the animations simply rely on inline svg code and plain CSS keyframe animationsâ€”

But one of my favorite animations features a little bit extra. The randomnness of the bubbles was created with the help of [Sass @for loops](http://thesassway.com/intermediate/if-for-each-while#for) and the [Sass Random() function](https://blog.codepen.io/2013/08/26/random-function-in-sass/)

## 2. Toast

I'll always be nostalgic about toast, even if I'm gluten-free and don't eat it often. I drew these illustrations and then created an animation with After Effects for one of them that you can check out [on Instagram >>](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcxgEW1FmJk/?taken-by=tinykitelab)

I also created a simple staggered css animation with the text alone:

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="tinykite" data-slug-hash="rrROdr" data-preview="true" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="CSS Animation: Staggered Text">

## 3. A Very Chicago-ish Conway's Game of Life

My brother loves the mathematical concept/cellular automaton known as Conway's Game of Life. And while working on a website for him several years ago, I decided to create an animated illustration of the Chicago skyline, using [Greensock](https://greensock.com/), that would incorporate the automaton's rules in the way the lights of its Hancock Tower lit up.

I am somewhat embarassed by the illustration style by now, but I'll always be fascinated by how cellular automata and similar mathematical concepts can be incorporated into art and design.
